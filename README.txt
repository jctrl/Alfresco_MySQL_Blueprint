To create and deploy the Alfresco application blueprint, follow the steps in the AlfrescoGuide.pdf.

Before starting with the steps in the AlfrescoGuide.pdf, get the alfresco installer "alfresco-enterprise-4.0.1-installer-linux-x64.bin " and host it on a http/ftp file server that is accessible in to the deployed VMs.  

The files: configure_webapp.txt, install_db.txt, install_webapp.txt can be opened in a text editor to copy and paste the scripts during the steps in XPlannerGuide.pdf.
